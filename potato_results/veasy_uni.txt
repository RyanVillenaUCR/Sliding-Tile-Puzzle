Welcome to RyanVillenaUCR's 8-puzzle solver.
Type "1" to use "Trivial",
"2" to use "Very Easy",
"3" to use "Easy",
"4" to use "Doable",
"5" to use "Oh Boy",
or "6" to enter your own puzzle.
Enter your choice of algorithm:
1: Uniform Cost Search
2: A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic
3: A* with the Manhattan distance heuristic
